In this example, the CSS code is added inside the style tags in the head section of the HTML file. The grid class is applied to the div element that contains the grid. The div elements inside the grid are styled with a border, padding, and a white background color.

The thicker borders are added to every third vertical and every third horizontal line using the :nth-child selector. The first selector (:nth-child(3n)) selects every third element in the grid starting from the first element. The second selector (:nth-child(n+7):nth-child(-n+9)) selects the 7th, 8th, and 9th elements in the grid. Together, these selectors apply a thicker border to every third vertical and horizontal line in the grid.
